# AWS Tools & Guides Repository

A personal collection of AWS tools, setup guides, and resources that I've found useful in my work with AWS services.

## Why This Repository?

I created this repository to document and share the various AWS tools, configurations, and guides I develop or discover. Rather than keeping these scattered across different locations, this serves as a centralized place where I can:

- Document setup processes for future reference
- Share useful AWS configurations and scripts
- Keep track of best practices and lessons learned
- Provide resources that others might find helpful

## Current Contents

- **[MCP Server Setup Guide](./MCP_Server_Setup_Guide.md)** - Complete guide for adding AWS Documentation MCP server to Amazon Q CLI

## About the Content

Each guide includes tested, step-by-step instructions with troubleshooting tips. All content is based on real implementations and practical experience with AWS services.
